# Learning

This organization collects repositories created during structured learning activities.

The focus here is on **understanding concepts**, exploring technologies, and consolidating knowledge through practice.  
Repositories may originate from courses, self-study sessions, or targeted technical deep dives.

## What to expect

- Educational code and exercises
- Notes and examples created while learning
- Small spikes to understand specific concepts or tools

## What this is not

- Production-ready software
- Actively maintained projects
- Optimized or fully refactored codebases

This space is intentionally exploratory and iterative.
